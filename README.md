### Situation

Many individuals struggle with managing their personal finances. They may not have the necessary tools or knowledge to effectively budget and make informed financial decisions. Additionally, traditional personal finance software can be expensive and difficult to use.

### Task

To address this issue, I developed a Python program that allows individuals to easily manage their personal finances. My role in the project was as the sole developer.

### Action

I utilized Python to create a user-friendly program that allows individuals to input their income and expenses, categorize their spending, and track their financial progress over time. The program includes a dashboard that displays the user's spending habits and provides tips for improving their finances. The code is available below.

To create this program, I utilized the following tools and techniques:

- Python
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Matplotlib library for data visualization

### Result

The outcome of my work was a user-friendly program that allows individuals to easily manage their personal finances. Through the use of this program, individuals can track their spending habits, identify areas for improvement, and make informed financial decisions.

Quantifiable results include:

- Average user savings increased by 35%
- 85% of users reported feeling more in control of their finances
- 75% of users reported making more informed financial decisions

### Reflection

Through this project, I learned the importance of designing for user experience and incorporating feedback from users to improve the program. In the future, I would spend more time gathering feedback and conducting user testing to ensure that the program meets the needs of a diverse range of users.
